      <h4>About Us</h4>
      <p>
        Wattpad was cofounded by Lau and Yuen in November 2006 in a garage
         “with a vision to change the way we share stories.”<br> The idea behind
          the company was that readers could download an app to read and chat
          about fiction shared by professional and<br>aspiring writers from around the world.
